The following feature(s) require a Ko-fi one-time donation or monthly recurring donation:

* RPC Large Image Text

Nobody likes to pay for features; we know that. That's why we only put features behind a paywall that are not essential and, therefore, only the cherry on top of the cake.

🤫 _Psst: Sometimes we randomly give people in our Discord free access to the features!_

### How to get access

Go to [https://ko-fi.com/zephra](https://ko-fi.com/zephra) and choose between **One time** and **Monthly**.

### I donated but still can't use the feature(s)

Make sure to connect your Discord account to your Ko-fi account. [Connect now](https://ko-fi.com/Discord/Settings). Also, make sure to restart AMRPC after you've donated.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to be on the [zephra Discord](https://discord.gg/APDghNfJhQ) so zaphy (our bot) can check your roles!

If it still doesn't work, contact us on Discord. (AMRPC | [#support](https://discord.com/channels/518389564340043776/847525548733366272))
